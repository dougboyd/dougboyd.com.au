                    <p>Building a Van's RV-7 aircraft from a kit split across 20 years. This log documents the restart of construction work—daily progress through rudder assembly, fabrication techniques, tool failures, parts mishaps, and lessons learned the hard way. Every mistake gets documented. Every rivet that doesn't sit flush gets recorded. This is the unfiltered build process.</p>
                    <p>Current focus: Empennage (tail section) assembly, starting with rudder construction, surface preparation, and priming systems.</p>

                            <p>Spent half an hour cleaning the shop, then it's time to disassemble the rudder in prep for dimpling, deburring, etching, cleaning, and priming before final assembly. Need to do some research on the trailing edge approach as well.</p>

                            <p>Back to work on the rudder, page 6-6 on the plans. Last week I got all skins clecoed on. Just finished drilling all skins to #40, including the trailing edge.</p>

                            <p><strong>Critical warning on the R-710 trim and fit:</strong> This cut is deceiving. I'd recommend reading as much about it as possible before starting to remove material. The gist of the danger is this—if the cut line is too far in, you won't have enough space for the rivets which need to come through from the skins.</p>

                            <p>Next step was to fabricate the R-918 bottom attach strips. Nothing unusual—just follow the instructions. Of interest: I needed to go out and purchase an imperial ruler for this step.</p>

                            <p>Starting on the rudder. Got all the backrivetted stiffeners in place, now isolating the required parts for cleaning and work.</p>

                            <p><strong>Major mistake on R-904 and R-902:</strong> The "enlarge the hole in the flange" instruction completely screwed me. I tried to do it with my horrible Ozito battery drill, thinking it would be fine (after not being able to mount it on my drill press). It munged the part and ripped the hole.</p>

                            <p>Ugh.</p>

                            <p><strong>Fortunate outcome:</strong> I had spare 904 and 902 parts. Even more fortunate—Ian Warburton was a close call away. An hour later, I had the air compressor hooked up, had looked at a few online pics, and managed to brace and step drill the piece in six different steps using proper tools.</p>

Fortunately, I've learned that EVERYTHING with this build needs to be checked online first. The stock provided is actually 3 different thicknesses. And I'm working with parts from two different builds split by 20 years.</p>

                            <p>Made the decision to start again as I've now got all the parts for the empennage.
