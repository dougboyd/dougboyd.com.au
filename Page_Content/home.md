***Creative Writing with AI
Please generate a couple of fun and witty paragraphs, welcoming visitors to my site. Use as much of my voice as possible, based on the content found on the rest of the site. Please also include any changes to the site since last publication...something like "hey, you might wanna check out [link and description to new features"] - it's new in this instance.

For reference, I'm Doug and my interests are software engineering, music, fitness, and building a Vans RV7a. I like to create things and will be using this site as both a record of personal accountability and a way to share my adventures.

Include the Buttondown material for subscribers. Make sure to write some nice text...
