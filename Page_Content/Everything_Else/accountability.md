Accountability. The word of the year. Or at least of the moment....I'll certainly try to keep it going for longer than I have in the past. With that in mind, this will be a daily blog of my activities and footprints. Some might call it a journal, but I'm not of that ilk and will leave journalling to the pros. Or those prone to prose. 

Pro prosers?

Hmmmm.

January 13, 2026
A waste of day from the fitness point of view. I'm still coughing up chunks of lung and just don't feel right walking into an F45 class and throwing weights and germs around. Today was also a non-run day, so I accepted that I should just rest. 

And by rest, I mean that I was up at 0500 to drive Dim and Chloe to Sydney. To catch you up the story...my daughter, Chloe, has been invited to attend Southern Methodist Univeristy in Dallas, Texas (yeee-haaw).

This meant all sorts of fun and games with NCAA and that most August Of Government Agencies, the folks in charge of the US Visa system. Well, last night we finally got the email that Chloe's F1 Student Visa had been approved and was ready for pickup. In Sydney. Because the Embassy here in Canberra was just too convenient.

Maybe they were having the drapes redone. Floors polished? Ran out of loo paper and closed to the public?

For whatever reason, pickup was in Sydney. And a quick call to SMU later saw that Chloe was to fly to Dallas tomorrow. And Dim was planning on going with for the first handful of days to settle her in. Which brings us to last night, with four large suitcases and a 19 year old trying to shoehorn her life into three of them.

This morning came soon enough....packing the truck, feeling our hearts break a little as our little girl said goodbye to her puppies and grew up just a little more. Then the drive to Sydney, the picking up of the Visa, and dropping my girls off at the Rydges by the International terminal.

And now, I'm in the house with Ash and Rosie prowling the floors. They know she's left, but haven't figured out for how long. Feels like a much bigger house than it did yesterday. 

...time will pass...

And tomorrow morning looks like a great morning for a dawn run. 

I promise not all of these will be this forelorn. Truly. And I did do something creative and task-worthy today - my Numatx rivet press had developed an oil leak and I sent off the main barrel to the states. AND I rewired the home wifi network! 

OK, not terribly epic. But at least something.
