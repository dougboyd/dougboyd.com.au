***Creative Writing With AI

This site is a static, flat HTML site. It is generated, in full, every time I run the appropriate command. In full means everything - layout, text, image placement. And since the AI agent is in charge of the layout/look and feel, I expect it to get a little bit nuts every now and again.

***Instructional - this image should have text wrapped around it. Use the description as a caption.

I've written content which falls into three different varieties:

1. Bullet points/notes with the instruction to have my AI agent generate the text using a couple of sample files which I've written to capture my particular "voice". I use this for much of my generic article and content generation

2. Formal/technical writing - very similar to point 1, except that I've asked the agent to assume a more formal/technical tone.

3. No AI intervention...in this instance, the AI agent is taking my existing text and providing layout/formatting only.

***No AI
It's probably best that I provide a bit of an example...the text above this line on the page is generated from my notes/bullet points. This specific paragraph is written by myself, and is unaltered from the original text. The material below is the technical voice, where I've asked the agent to explain how the site is generated and published, including the environments and technology. 

***Formal Writing With AI
Explain:

* how this site is generated/built.
* the technology behind the hosting
* the dev/prod structures
* the publishing process
* Buttondown
* KoFi
* Google Analytics 4 for visitor tracking

Please include a reference to the git repo if people want to see what/how and use it in their own structures.

***Creative Writing With AI
And the why...I've written this site for a handful of reasons:

1. To showcase what can be done with a simple understanding of the current tools. 
2. To provide a log of my current works
3. To hold myself accountable. As my good mate Eamon Kenny is teaching me, accountability and personal honesty are everything.
