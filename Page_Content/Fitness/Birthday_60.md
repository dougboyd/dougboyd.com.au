My 60th birthday is July 7, 2026. In an effort to tempt fate and prove out my stupidity levels, I'm publically committing to a 60k run on the weekend before. 

***Instructions
Read the training plan from this link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tn8oneUYuSvKmjbcsj57SK5dZdHZ_YJfe1PnQHPWPKc/edit?usp=sharing

Don't just provide a link in the material below...please reproduce the plan itself. I'm updating it quite frequently and people should be able to see what I'm doing.

I invite you to follow my progress...here's my training plan. Note that I'll be updating the notes area of the plan after every run, and probably include a few pics.

Tough run. Midday heat, I'm still feeling a bit sick, and my running form has gone to hell in an F45 handbasket. The run was on the Mt. Ainslie Park Run course. 

Stats
Distance: 5k
Surface: Mildy undulating trail
Temp: 27c
Conditions: Direct sun, light breeze
Body: horrible form, sore quads at finish

Reach out to me if you'd like to join in on a run (very slow) or have any other comments.
