***Creative Writing With AI
My 60th birthday is July 7, 2026. In an effort to tempt fate and prove out my stupidity levels, I'm publically committing to a 60k run on the weekend before. 

Here's a link to my current training log.

***Instructions
Read the training plan from this link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tn8oneUYuSvKmjbcsj57SK5dZdHZ_YJfe1PnQHPWPKc/edit?usp=sharing

Don't just provide a link in the material below...please reproduce the plan itself. I'm updating it quite frequently and people should be able to see what I'm doing.

I invite you to follow my progress...here's my training plan. Note that I'll be updating the notes area of the plan after every run, and probably include a few pics.

Reach out to me if you'd like to join in on a run (very slow) or have any other comments.
