My 60th birthday is July 7, 2026. In an effort to tempt fate and prove out my stupidity levels, I'm publically committing to a 60k run on the weekend before. 

***Instructions
Read the training plan from this link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tn8oneUYuSvKmjbcsj57SK5dZdHZ_YJfe1PnQHPWPKc/edit?usp=sharing

Don't just provide a link in the material below...please reproduce the plan itself. I'm updating it quite frequently and people should be able to see what I'm doing.

I invite you to follow my progress...here's my training plan. Note that I'll be updating the notes area of the plan after every run, and probably include a few pics.

Tough run. Midday heat, I'm still feeling a bit sick, and my running form has gone to hell in an F45 handbasket. The run was on the Mt. Ainslie Park Run course. 

Stats
Distance: 5k
Surface: Mildy undulating trail
Temp: 27c
Vertical: 74m
Conditions: Direct sun, light breeze
Body: horrible form, sore quads at finish

Much better running conditions...0530, not hot, no wind. I chose to do laps of the "Ken's Chair" loop, because of the climb, drop, climb sequence. Bit of tightness in BOTH hamstrings at the start, but loosened up by the 2nd kilometre. While form isn't 'back' per say, it is much better.
