Tough run. Midday heat, I'm still feeling a bit sick, and my running form has gone to hell in an F45 handbasket. The run was on the Mt. Ainslie Park Run course.

Much better running conditions...0530, not hot, no wind. I chose to do laps of the "Ken's Chair" loop, because of the climb, drop, climb sequence. Bit of tightness in BOTH hamstrings at the start, but loosened up by the 2nd kilometre. While form isn't 'back' per say, it is much better.
