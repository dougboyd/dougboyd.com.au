Tough run. Midday heat, I'm still feeling a bit sick, and my running form has gone to hell in an F45 handbasket. The run was on the Mt. Ainslie Park Run course.

Much better running conditions...0530, not hot, no wind. I chose to do laps of the "Ken's Chair" loop, because of the climb, drop, climb sequence. Bit of tightness in BOTH hamstrings at the start, but loosened up by the 2nd kilometre. While form isn't 'back' per say, it is much better.

And I'm back...timing, comfortability, everything seems to have fallen just where I left it. Conditions were windy, with a bit of sideways mizzle.

Ran the Coolemon Ridge with Mt. Arawang climb...pretty much my standard 10k, featuring 3 nice climbs and lots of good runnable bits. A little niggle on the left outer shin, but nothing that didn't work out with time. Feeling a bit stiff tonight, and will try to get an F45 in tomorrow morning.
