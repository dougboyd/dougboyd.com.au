Starting on the Rudder…looks like I’ve got all the backrivetted stiffeners in place, and am now about to RTFM and isolate the required parts for cleaning/work.

The shop as it sits now.

Looking at R-917, I need to fabricate from the stock which was provided. Fortunately, I’ve learned that EVERYTHING with this damned thing needs to be checked online…the stock provided is actually 3 different thicknesses. And I’m playing with parts from two different builds, split by 20 years.

Ugh.

Got out the micrometer and started working it all out. Sorted now.

And then there's r-904. Learned that cutting without back plate will rip the part. Fortunately, I had a spare from the earlier kit.
