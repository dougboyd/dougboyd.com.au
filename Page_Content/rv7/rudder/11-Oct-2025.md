Have decided to restart the build and pull everything out of storage. What a mess. Dust, grime, and mouse poo. 

Made the decision to start again as I’ve now got all the parts for the emp. Researched primer systems and purchased Stewart Systems Ekoclean, EkoEtch, and EkoPrime. Still need to configure air compressor and get paint gun, and paint lid.

Paint Gun System: 3M Accuspray Paint Spray Gun System with PPS 2.0, 26580
