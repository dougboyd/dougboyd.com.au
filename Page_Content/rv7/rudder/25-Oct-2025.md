Back to work on the Rudder, page 6-6 on the plans. Last week, I got the skins clecoed on. Just finished drilling all skins to #40, including the trailing edge. 

And here’s the final fit…this cut was deceiving and I’d recommend reading as much about it as possible before starting to remove material. The gist of the danger is this – if the cut line is too far in, you’ll not have enough space for the rivets which need to come through from the skins. 

Next step was to fabricate the R-918 bottom attach strips. Nothing unusual…just follow the instructions. Of interest was my need to go out and purchase an imperial ruler.
