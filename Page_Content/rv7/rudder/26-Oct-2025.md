Spent half an hour cleaning the shop…and then it’s time to disassemble the rudder in prep of the dimple/deburr/etch/clean/prime before final assembly. Need to do some research on the trailing edge as well.

Pulled the dimpling rig out and did both skins before realizing that I should have deburred first. <sigh>. On close inspection, no damage was done.
