***Creative Writing with AI

I discovered aircraft building when in Alaska on the ships back in 1990 - those guys have 8 months of winter and build all sorts of craziness. I originally dreamed of building a canard of some type - was attracted to the Velocity and CozyMkIV. And I actually purchased Cozy plans in 2002...they're in my basement, even today. But then, after a bit of research, i realised that Australia was probably the wrong country (not enough sealed runways).

Researched and discovered the Vans RV7. Perfect fit for long distance single engine and gentleman aerobatics.

Started this project in 2008, back in Rouse Hill. Got the emp kit and learned just enough to be stupid. Once moved from Rouse Hill to Galston, never got restarted and the project got mothballed.

Fast forward to 2023 - reordered the emp, and restarted. Did it too soon, as kids were still in the forefront...now, finally getting back, slowly, to it. 

These pages document my progress and, at times, seeming lack of. I'm still building out my shop. Still working on a work flow. But this page is helping keep it going.
