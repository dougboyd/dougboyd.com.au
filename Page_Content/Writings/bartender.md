There's this place I go to every now and again...grab a couple of pizzas for the fam, have a pint at the bar while I wait.
I'm friendly...perhaps overly so...and am always on the lookout for sparky kinda individuals to have a conversation with.
About four years back, the bartender that night was just that kind of sparky. Really switched on, nice, intelligent.
I asked what he was doing, and he said he was waiting to get into the Australian Defence Force. Had a very specific area that he wanted to get into and had been trying for a while.
I encouraged him to keep at it. Shared a bit about where I was, with Chloe in her swimming, Lachs in the later part of his school, Dim with her new horse...just normal stuff.
Pizza arrived and I left, filing his name into my grey matter.
For the next two years, he was off and on at the same place...if I saw him, we'd hang while I waited for the pizza. His application was moving, then it wasn't, and then it was again. He was in shape, out of shape, happy, not so happy, but always facing the same direction and never beaten.
And he'd always remember about my fam, as I'd remember about his plans. 
And then last year, I wandered in and found him on his very last day before shipping out...he'd finally made it through and was about to hit boot camp.
I was super pumped for him...wished him the best and said to stay in touch.
Fast forward to yesterday - a year has past. My own son has graduated from his Bootcamp journey with the Navy. My wife is progressing with her career. My daughter has just moved to Dallas to swim for SMU. And I went out to grab a pizza for myself...you can see where this is going.
The guy sitting at the bar was both slimmer and bigger...bootcamp had done him well. He was the same, but had more iron. It was seriously impressive, especially with the history that I'd seen with him through the years. 
Change happens. Sometimes so slowly that we don't see it until an epoch passes. But it's continual. And every day you've gotta keep your compass aligned with where you want to go.
Congrats, mate. Chase down that dream.
