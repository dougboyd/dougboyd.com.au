***Write with AI. Make it good.

My writing area. Home to a bunch of random thoughts and sometimes wierd stories. Mostly autobiographical with a healthy dose of "I can't remember it completely so I've filled in the blanks.

If you think you recognise something in here...maybe something you've been part of, then it's probably by accident. 

Just remember - if Hunter S. Thompson really had done all of the stuff he claimed to do...well, he probably wouldn't have been able to find the damn typewriter.
