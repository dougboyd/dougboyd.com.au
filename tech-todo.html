                    <!-- Creative Writing with AI -->
                    <p>Here it is...my high tech, big picture to do list. No project management software, no Gantt charts, no burndown velocity metrics. Just a markdown file that gets regenerated into HTML every time I build the site. If it's on this list, it's either in progress, planned, or abandoned but not yet deleted. That's the beauty of radical transparency—you get to see the entire mess, not just the success stories.</p>

                    <p>Some of these will happen. Some won't. Some will morph into completely different projects halfway through. That's how real work goes. The list exists to hold me accountable, not to impress anyone with my organizational prowess.</p>

                    <h2>Regarding This Site</h2>
                    <ul class="deployment-steps">
                        <li><strong>Create some way to "join" and be notified when a new version comes out.</strong> This will turn into a mailing list. <em>(Update: Completed! Buttondown integration is live.)</em></li>
                        <li><strong>Include a contact me page.</strong> Simple form, email backend, nothing fancy. Just a way for people to reach out without hunting down social media profiles.</li>
                        <li><strong>Add Patreon.</strong> Alternative or complement to Ko-fi. Give people options for how they want to support the work. Monthly subscriptions, different tiers, exclusive content—still figuring out what makes sense here.</li>
                        <li><strong>Add my 60k run plan.</strong> Training protocol for ultramarathons. Structured progression, weekly mileage targets, recovery strategies. This goes in the Fitness section once it's actually written down properly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Add fitness goals.</strong> Include warnings about progress photos of my Wisconsin-shaped body. No Instagram filters, no strategic lighting, just honest documentation of what sustainable fitness looks like for someone who codes 40+ hours a week.</li>
                        <li><strong>Add Vivanti reference.</strong> Include my role as Partner, Canberra Region, and a reference to the Vivanti.com website. Also include a blurb on what Vivanti does—enterprise software consulting, digital transformation, that whole space. This probably goes in an "Everything Else" or professional section.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Regarding Other Ventures</h2>
                    <ul class="deployment-steps">
                        <li><strong>Family planner - calendar, todo, etc.</strong> Already under way. Centralized hub for family scheduling, shared task lists, meal planning, all the logistics that keep a household functioning. Building it as a web app, probably deploying to Azure, definitely overengineering it because that's how I learn new tech stacks.</li>
                    </ul>

The timestamp in the footer shows when this page was last regenerated. If you're reading this and thinking "half of these will never happen"—you're probably right. But at least they're documented.</em></p>
