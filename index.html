                    <!-- Creative Writing with AI - Welcome content -->
                    <p>Welcome! You've found the corner of the internet where I document what I'm building, breaking, and occasionally managing to finish. I'm Doug—software engineer by trade, aircraft builder by ambition, ultrarunner by questionable life choices, and relentless tinkerer by constitution. This site exists as both a public record and a personal accountability mechanism. If it's timestamped and visible, I can't pretend it went differently six months from now.</p>

                    <p>The whole thing regenerates from scratch every time I update it. New design, fresh content, completely different color scheme if the AI feels creative that day. You're currently looking at the "Sunset Vibes" iteration—warm corals, bright turquoise, sunny yellows. Last build was all dark blues and terminal minimalism. Next build? Who knows. That's the point. Nothing stays the same because nothing should feel permanent when you're documenting work in progress.</p>

                    <p><strong>NEW IN THIS BUILD:</strong> The <a href="tech.html">Tech section</a> now has a proper tree structure—check out <a href="tech-about.html">About This Site</a> for the complete technical breakdown of how this whole AI-powered static generation works, and <a href="tech-todo.html">To Do List</a> for the brutally honest roadmap of what's planned, in progress, or abandoned but not yet deleted. The <a href="rv7-builders-log.html">RV-7 Build Log</a> is live with the latest empennage work—priming, riveting, and documenting every mistake along the way.</p>

                        <h2>RV-7 Aircraft Build</h2>
                        <p>Van's RV-7 kit aircraft construction. Daily logs tracking fabrication work, tool decisions, mistakes made, and lessons learned. Currently working through empennage assembly—vertical stabilizer, rudder, horizontal stabilizer. Every rivet that doesn't sit flush gets documented. Every damaged part gets photographed and explained.</p>

                        <p>Training protocols, nutrition experiments, performance data. Sustainable strength training and endurance work for the long game. What actually produces results when you're balancing real life with athletic goals. Ultramarathon race reports, training plans, and the honest accounting of what worked and what didn't.</p>

How this site works—AI-powered static generation, Azure hosting, complete regeneration from markdown every time I run the build command. Implementation details, deployment strategies, and the radical transparency approach to documenting technical work.</p>

Structured thinking about technical challenges, design trade-offs, ultramarathon race experiences, and the occasional philosophical tangent when the problem demands it.

                        <p>Projects that don't fit cleanly into categories. One-off builds, experimental tools, quick prototypes, side quests that seemed reasonable at 2 AM. The catch-all for work that defies organization. Family planner development, random software experiments, and whatever else ends up here.</p>
