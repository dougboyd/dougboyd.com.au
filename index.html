                    <p>Welcome! You've stumbled onto my corner of the internet where I document what I'm building, what I'm breaking, and what I'm learning from both. I'm Doug—software engineer by profession, aircraft builder by ambition, ultrarunner by choice (questionable as that may be), and chronic documenter of absolutely everything. This site exists because if I don't write it down with a timestamp, future-me will absolutely misremember how it actually went.</p>

                    <p>Here's the deal with this site: it regenerates completely from scratch every time I update it. New design, different colors, entirely fresh layout—whatever the AI decides looks good that particular day. Right now you're looking at the "Bright Meadow" iteration with soft greens, warm creams, and energetic oranges. Last build was all sunset vibes and coral. Next build? Your guess is as good as mine. Nothing stays static because documentation should reflect that work is always evolving.</p>

                    <p><strong>NEW IN THIS BUILD:</strong> The <a href="rv7-builders-log.html">RV-7 Build Log</a> has proper daily entries now—every rivet, every mistake, every "wait, that's not supposed to bend like that" moment is documented with photos and timestamps. The <a href="tech.html">Tech section</a> has expanded with <a href="tech-about.html">About This Site</a> explaining the entire AI-powered regeneration system, plus <a href="tech-todo.html">To Do List</a> showing what's actually getting built versus what's aspirational. Email notifications now work (after some debugging)—subscribe below and you'll get notified when new builds deploy.</p>

Currently working through the empennage—vertical stabilizer and rudder assembly complete, horizontal stabilizer in progress. Every rivet gets photographed, every mistake gets documented with painful honesty, every decision about tools and techniques gets explained. This is the unfiltered reality of amateur aircraft construction: the victories, the setbacks, and the steep learning curve.</p>
