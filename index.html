                    <p>Welcome to the place where I document everything I'm working on—unfiltered. No portfolio polish here. This is the raw feed: code that compiles (sometimes), aluminum that gets riveted (occasionally on the first try), trail runs that humble me, and the honest accounting of all of it.</p>

                    <p>I'm Doug. I write software professionally, build a Van's RV-7 aircraft because therapy costs more than rivets, and run ultramarathons because 12 hours at a desk demands a counterbalance. What ties it all together? Accountability. This site regenerates completely from scratch with each build—new design, fresh content, timestamped progress. No retrospective genius. No airbrushing the failures. Just the real work.</p>

                    <p><strong>NEW IN THIS BUILD:</strong> Complete visual redesign with Terminal Minimalism theme—deep blues, vibrant accents, modern typography. Ko-fi support button now live in the footer (PayPal + Stripe). The <a href="tech.html">Tech</a> section explains how this entire site regenerates from markdown every time I run the build command. Check the <a href="rv7-builders-log.html">RV-7 Build Log</a> for the latest aircraft construction updates.</p>
