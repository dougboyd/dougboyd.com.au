                    <h3>The Challenge: R-904 and R-902</h3>
                    <p>Was working on the rudder….specifically, R-904 and R-902. The "enlarge the hole in the flange" completely screwed me. I tried to do it with my horrible Ozito, thinking a battery powered drill would be fine (after not being able to mount it on my drill press). Alas, it munged the part and ripped the hole.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ugh.</strong></p>

                    <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
                    <p>Fortunately, I had a spare 904 and 902. Even more fortunate, I had Ian Warburton at close call. An hour later, I had my air compressor hooked up, had looked at a few online pics, and managed to brace/step drill the piece in six different steps.</p>

                    <h3>R-917 Fabrication</h3>
                    <p>Looking at R-917, I need to fabricate from the stock which was provided. Fortunately, I've learned that EVERYTHING with this damned thing needs to be checked online…the stock provided is actually 3 different thicknesses. And I'm playing with parts from two different builds, split by 20 years.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ugh.</strong></p>

                    <p>Got out the micrometer and started working it all out. Sorted now.</p>

                    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Always use proper tools - air compressor and step drilling for precision work</li>
                        <li>Check everything online before assuming parts are correct</li>
                        <li>Mixing parts from different build vintages requires careful measurement</li>
                        <li>Having spare parts is a lifesaver</li>
                    </ul>
