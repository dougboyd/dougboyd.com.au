                    <h2>60K Birthday Run - July 2026</h2>

                    <p>My 60th birthday is July 7, 2026. In an effort to tempt fate and prove out my stupidity levels, I'm publicly committing to a 60k run on the weekend before. Because nothing says "responsible life choices" like deciding to run an ultramarathon as a birthday celebration.</p>

                    <p>This isn't my first rodeo with questionable distance goals, but it's the first one I'm documenting from start to finish with full accountability. Every week, every run, every adjustment to the plan gets logged. If I bail, you'll know. If I succeed, you'll know. If I end up hobbling through the back half wondering why I thought this was a good idea—you'll definitely know about that too.</p>

                    <h3>The Training Plan</h3>

                    <p>I invite you to follow my progress. The plan is a 25-week structured buildout (January 12 – July 4) targeting the Canberra Centenary Trail 60km route. I'm updating the notes section after every run, documenting what worked, what didn't, and probably including a few pics along the way.</p>

                    <h3>Plan Overview</h3>

                    <p><strong>Phase 1 (Weeks 1-7): Base Building</strong><br>
                    Easy runs (5-10km), tempo work, and long runs progressing to 21km. I'm also doing 5 F45 resistance sessions weekly through Week 7 to maintain strength while building aerobic base.</p>

                    <p><strong>Phase 2 (Weeks 8-15): Endurance Development</strong><br>
                    Trail-specific training kicks in here. Long runs start hitting proper distance—building to a 45km peak in Week 15 (April 25). This is where I'll test gear, nutrition, and hydration strategies under race-like conditions. F45 drops to 3 sessions per week from Week 9 onward to prioritize recovery.</p>

                    <p><strong>Phase 3 (Weeks 16-22): Final Buildup</strong><br>
                    Long runs stay in the 25-32km range on trails. Focus shifts to hill power-hiking, downhill running technique, and dialing in race-day logistics. Continued practice with nutrition and hydration protocols.</p>

                    <p><strong>Phase 4 (Weeks 23-24): Taper</strong><br>
                    Volume drops 50-75% to arrive at race day fresh. Short, easy runs with minimal intensity. This is the hardest part—trusting the training and not overthinking it.</p>

                    <p><strong>Race Week (Week 25):</strong><br>
                    Final light prep, gear check, and execution. July 4, 2026. Canberra Centenary Trail. 60 kilometers. Let's see how this goes.</p>

                    <h3>Why Document This?</h3>

                    <p>Accountability works. Public commitment means I can't quietly abandon this when it gets hard (and it will get hard). The training log serves as both a record and a forcing function—if I skip runs or bail on the plan, it's visible. That matters.</p>

                    <p>Also, ultramarathon training is absurd and documenting absurdity makes it slightly more tolerable. If you're thinking about doing something similar—or if you just want to watch someone make questionable fitness decisions in real time—this is your chance.</p>

                    <p>If you're in Canberra and want to join for a run (very slow, I promise), reach out. If you have comments, questions, or just want to tell me this is a terrible idea—also reach out. Contact details are on the <a href="index.html">homepage</a>.</p>
